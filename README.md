# Bearchain

This repository was created as an avenue to explore different tools and purposes
for interacting with blockchains. This includes smart contract development, 
Golang bindings, and more. The hope is to tie this into the Bearclave project
by making end-to-end Data Oracle and Off-Chain Compute examples.
